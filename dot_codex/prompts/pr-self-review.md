# PR Self-Review Workflow

## Your task

Systematically review the user's recently created PR with a focus on Python/ML and dbt/SQL code quality. Follow this comprehensive review workflow:

### 1. Gather PR Information

First, identify and fetch the most recent PR created by the user:

```bash
# Get user's recent PRs
GITHUB_USER=$(gh api user -q .login)
gh pr list --author "$GITHUB_USER" --limit 5 --json number,title,url,createdAt,draft,headRefName

# Select the most recent PR
PR_NUMBER=[Selected PR number]
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json headRefName -q .headRefName)

# Fetch PR details
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,files,commits,additions,deletions,changedFiles

# Get file changes
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --name-only
```

### 2. Automated Quality Checks

Run automated checks before manual review:

```bash
# Switch to PR branch
git checkout $PR_BRANCH
git pull origin $PR_BRANCH

# General checks
echo "=== Security & Dependencies ==="
# Check for secrets
git secrets --scan
# Check dependencies
pip-audit || uv pip audit
```

### 3. Code Review Checklist

  - Proper normalization (3NF where appropriate)
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Appropriate indexes for queries
  - Foreign key constraints defined
  - Audit columns (created_at, updated_at, etc.)
  - Soft delete strategy if applicable

- [ ] **Multi-tenant Architecture**
  - Clear tenant isolation strategy
  - Parameterized tenant identification
  - No hardcoded client-specific logic
  - Abstraction layer for schema differences
  - Configuration-driven behavior

- [ ] **Query Abstraction Patterns**
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Query builder for dynamic conditions
  - Client-specific mapping configuration
  - Common interface despite schema variations
```

#### Example: Multi-tenant Query Pattern

```python
class BaseRepository(ABC):
    """Abstract repository for multi-tenant queries"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_table_mapping(self, client_id: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Get client-specific table/column mappings"""
        pass
    
    def build_query(self, client_id: str, base_query: str) -> str:
        """Build client-specific query from base template"""
        mapping = self.get_table_mapping(client_id)
        return base_query.format(**mapping)

# Good: Abstracted query
class OrderRepository(BaseRepository):
    def get_orders(self, client_id: str, filters: Dict) -> List[Order]:
        base_query = """
        SELECT {order_id_col}, {customer_col}, {amount_col}
        FROM {order_table}
        WHERE {tenant_col} = :tenant_id
        """
        query = self.build_query(client_id, base_query)
        # Execute with client-specific mappings

# Bad: Hardcoded client logic
def get_orders_bad(client_id: str):
    if client_id == "client_a":
        query = "SELECT order_id, cust_name FROM orders_a"
    elif client_id == "client_b":
        query = "SELECT id, customer FROM client_b_orders"
    # This doesn't scale!
```

#### dbt Multi-tenant Patterns

```sql
-- Good: Using variables for client-specific logic
{% set client_config = var('client_configs')[var('client_id')] %}

WITH base_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        {{ client_config.order_id_column }} AS order_id,
        {{ client_config.customer_column }} AS customer_name,
        {{ client_config.amount_column }} AS amount
    FROM {{ ref(client_config.order_table) }}
    WHERE {{ client_config.tenant_column }} = '{{ var("client_id") }}'
)

-- Bad: Hardcoded client conditions
WITH orders AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM {{ ref('orders') }}
    WHERE 
        {% if var('client_id') == 'client_a' %}
            tenant_id = 'A' AND status != 'DELETED'
        {% elif var('client_id') == 'client_b' %}
            client_code = 'B' AND is_active = true
        {% endif %}
    -- This becomes unmaintainable quickly!
)
```

        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.statistics
        WHERE table_name = key_column_usage.table_name
            AND column_name = key_column_usage.column_name
    );

    'naming_inconsistency' as issue_type,
    table_name,
    column_name,
    CASE
        WHEN column_name NOT LIKE '%_id' AND data_type = 'bigint' 
            THEN 'ID columns should end with _id'
        WHEN column_name NOT LIKE '%_at' AND column_name IN ('created', 'updated', 'deleted')
            THEN 'Timestamp columns should end with _at'
        ELSE 'Check naming convention'
    END as recommendation
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'your_schema';
```
