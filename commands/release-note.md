# Release Note Creation Guide

## Your task

Based on the above changes and PR history, create a comprehensive release note following these steps:

### 1. Gather PR and Commit Information

First, collect both PR and commit information for the release period:

```bash
# Get PR history since last release
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 --json number,title,body,mergedAt,author,labels,url

# Get detailed commit history
git log --oneline --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --pretty=format:"%h %s (%an, %ad)" --date=short

# Get PR-commit associations
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 --json number,title,mergeCommit
```

### 2. Determine Version Number

- Previous release: Check from the context above
- New version: Increment patch version (v2.4.X ‚Üí v2.4.X+1)
- Consider semantic versioning based on change types

### 3. Analyze and Categorize Changes

Analyze both PR titles/descriptions and commits to categorize into:

**Categories:**

- **‚ú® New Features**: New functionality or enhancements
- **üêõ Bug Fixes**: Issue resolutions and error corrections  
- **üìù Documentation**: Documentation updates and improvements
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring**: Code restructuring without behavior changes
- **‚ö° Performance**: Performance improvements and optimizations
- **üîß Maintenance**: Dependency updates, tooling changes
- **üö® Breaking Changes**: Changes that may affect compatibility

**Analysis Priority:**

1. PR titles and descriptions (primary source)
2. PR labels and reviewers' feedback
3. Individual commit messages (supplementary)
4. Related issues mentioned in PRs

### 4. Create Release Note

Use this enhanced template with both PR and commit links:

```markdown
## vX.X.X - YYYY-MM-DD

### ‚ú® New Features
- [Feature description] ([PR #123](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123))

### üîß Maintenance
- [Maintenance update] ([PR #127](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/127))

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/vX.X.X...vY.Y.Y

### 5. Create GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create vX.X.X --title "vX.X.X" --notes "[Release note content]"
```

## Enhanced Analysis Guidelines

### PR Information Priority

1. **PR Title**: Primary source for change description
2. **PR Body**: Context, motivation, and implementation details
3. **PR Labels**: Help with automatic categorization
4. **Review Comments**: Additional insights and edge cases
5. **Linked Issues**: Background and user impact

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] All merged PRs since last release are included
- [ ] Each change links to both PR and relevant commits
